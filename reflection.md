- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance seems really useful for instances like this where we need to make different types of one general thing. It made it easier as I didn't have to copy and paste a bunch of code and could simply add or replace what I needed. I would say overall it was a good experience, following the rubric made it a lot simpler and easier to digest and easier for me to focus on practicing the techniques rather than worrying on other problems. For advice I would say to work at this project in chuncks and don't get overwhelmed, just start small and see where you go.
